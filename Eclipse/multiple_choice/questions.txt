Questions 36-37 refer to the following information.
Consider the following binarySearch method. The method correctly performs a binary search.
/** Precondition: data is sorted in increasing order. */
public static int binarySearch(int[] data, int target)
{
int start = 0;
int end = data.length - 1;
while (start <= end)
{
int mid = (start + end) / 2;
/* Calculate midpoint */
if (target < data[mid])
{
end = mid - 1;
}
else if (target > data[mid])
{
start = mid + 1;
}
else
{
return mid;
}
}
return -1;
}

36. Consider the following code segment.
int[] values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 8, 8};
int target = 8;
What value is returned by the call binarySearch(values, target) ?
(A) -1
(B) 3
(C) 5
(D) 6
(E) 8

37. Suppose the binarySearch method is called with an array containing 2,000 elements sorted in increasing
order. What is the maximum number of times that the statement indicated by /* Calculate midpoint */
could execute?
(A) 2,000
(B) 1,000
(C) 20
(D) 11
(E) 1

38. Consider the following incomplete method that is intended to return a string formed by concatenating elements
from the parameter words. The elements to be concatenated start with startIndex and continue through
the last element of words and should appear in reverse order in the resulting string.
/** Precondition: words.length > 0;
*
startIndex >= 0
*/
public static String concatWords(String[] words, int startIndex)
{
String result = "";
/* missing code */
return result;
}
For example, the following code segment uses a call to the concatWords method.
String[] things = {"Bear", "Apple", "Gorilla", "House", "Car"};
System.out.println(concatWords(things, 2));
When the code segment is executed, the string "CarHouseGorilla" is printed.
The following three code segments have been proposed as replacements for /* missing code */.
I.

II.

III.

for (int k = startIndex; k < words.length; k++)
{
result += words[k] + words[words.length - k - 1];
}
int k = words.length - 1;
while (k >= startIndex)
{
result += words[k];
k--;
}
String[] temp = new String[words.length];
for (int k = 0; k <= words.length / 2; k++)
{
temp[k] = words[words.length - k - 1];
temp[words.length - k - 1] = words[k];
}
for (int k = 0; k < temp.length - startIndex; k++)
{
result += temp[k];
}

Which of these code segments can be used to replace /* missing code */ so that concatWords will
work as intended?
(A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D) I and II
(E) II and III

39. Consider the following method.
/** Precondition: 0 < numVals <= nums.length */
public static int mystery(int[] nums, int v, int numVals)
{
int k = 0;
if (v == nums[numVals - 1])
{
k = 1;
}
if (numVals == 1)
{
return k;
}
else
{
return k + mystery(nums, v, numVals - 1);
}
}
Which of the following best describes what the call mystery(numbers, val, numbers.length)
does? You may assume that variables numbers and val have been declared and initialized.
(A) Returns 1 if the last element in numbers is equal to val; otherwise, returns 0
(B) Returns the index of the last element in numbers that is equal to val
(C) Returns the number of elements in numbers that are equal to val
(D) Returns the number of elements in numbers that are not equal to val
(E) Returns the maximum number of adjacent elements that are not equal to val
